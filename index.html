    <p>In <em>Fall 2024</em>, I set out on a journey across the globe, asking the same question to everyone I met:</p>
    <blockquote>“Who is God to you?”</blockquote>
    <p>The responses I received were as diverse as the people themselves—<em>ranging from Panamanian nature worshippers and Swiss atheists to Franciscan friars and Greek painters</em>. Yet, despite the differences, there was something deeply universal in their answers.</p>
    <p>Everywhere I went, I saw how humans are searching for a connection to the divine. This project is a visual representation of those responses and a reflection of my realization:</p>
    <blockquote>The globally shared prevalence of divine connection reveals how much more alike we are than different.</blockquote>
